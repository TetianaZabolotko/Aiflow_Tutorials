1.  Files can also be passed to the bash_command argument, like bash_command='templated_command.sh', where the file location 
    is relative to the directory containing the pipeline file (tutorial.py in this case). 
    This may be desirable for many reasons, like separating your scriptâ€™s logic and pipeline code, 
    allowing for proper code highlighting in files composed in different languages, and general 
    flexibility in structuring pipelines.
    It is also possible to define your template_searchpath as pointing to any folder locations in the DAG constructor call.
